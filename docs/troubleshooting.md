# Troubleshooting Guide

This troubleshooting guide will help you resolve common issues you might encounter while setting up and running the Automated Plant Watering System with ESP32 and ThingSpeak.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. ESP32 Not Connecting to WiFi
**Symptoms**: The ESP32 fails to connect to the WiFi network. Serial Monitor shows repeated connection attempts.

**Solutions**:
- **Check Credentials**: Ensure that the SSID and password in the code match your WiFi networkâ€™s credentials.
- **Signal Strength**: Ensure the ESP32 is within range of the WiFi router.
- **WiFi Channel**: Make sure your WiFi network is not on a very crowded channel.
- **Restart Router**: Restart your WiFi router.

### 2. Failed to Upload Code to ESP32
**Symptoms**: The upload process in the Arduino IDE fails, showing an error message.

**Solutions**:
- **Boot Mode**: Hold the `Boot` button on the ESP32 while the code is uploading, and release it when the upload starts.
- **USB Cable**: Ensure you are using a working USB cable.
- **Driver Installation**: Verify that you have the correct drivers installed for the ESP32. You can download them from the manufacturer's website.
- **Select Correct Board**: Ensure the correct board and port are selected in `Tools > Board` and `Tools > Port`.

### 3. Sensors Not Reading Correctly
**Symptoms**: Sensor values appear incorrect or do not change.

**Solutions**:
- **Connections**: Verify all connections are secure and correct according to the wiring instructions.
- **Power Supply**: Ensure the sensors and ESP32 are receiving adequate power.
- **Test Individually**: Test each sensor individually with simple test sketches to ensure they are functioning.

### 4. Data Not Appearing on ThingSpeak
**Symptoms**: No data appears on ThingSpeak channel despite the ESP32 sending data.

**Solutions**:
- **API Key**: Ensure the correct Write API Key is used in the code.
- **Channel Settings**: Verify that the fields in ThingSpeak channel settings match those used in the code.
- **Internet Connection**: Check that the ESP32 has a stable internet connection.

### 5. MATLAB Visualizations Not Updating
**Symptoms**: MATLAB visualizations on ThingSpeak do not show new data.

**Solutions**:
- **Data Points**: Ensure the number of data points retrieved in the MATLAB script is sufficient to include the latest data.
- **Script Execution**: Verify that the MATLAB script executes without errors.
- **Time Zone**: Check that the timestamps match your time zone settings in ThingSpeak.
